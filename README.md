This repo is to maintain the work the [Arizona State University Data Science Club](https://asudsc.wordpress.com/) is working on.  

Install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    - NOTE: During installation be sure to check the box for adding Python to the path
    - NOTE: at the end of installation allow python to get rid of max filename length

Install Jupyter: https://jupyter.org/install
    Step 1: Execute python command "python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip" from your command line (Terminal on Mac/Linux, Powershell in Windows)
    - NOTE: On windows you will need to execute py not python3 so the command would be "py -m pip install --upgrade pip"
    Step 2: Install Jupyter using Python by executing "python3 -m pip install jupyter"
    - NOTE: On windows you will need to execute py not python3 so the command would be "py -m pip install jupyter"
